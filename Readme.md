Markov Chains
----------------------------

A Markov chain is a mathematical model that describes a system's transition from one state to another over a sequence of discrete time steps. 
The key idea is that the probability of transitioning to the next state depends only on the current state and is independent of how the system arrived at that state. 
Markov chains are widely used in various fields.This R script demonstrates how to use Markov chains to analyze and generate text based on lyrics text files.
