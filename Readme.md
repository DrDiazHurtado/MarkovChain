Markov Chains
----------------------------

A Markov chain is a mathematical model that describes a system's transition from one state to another over a sequence of discrete time steps. 
The key idea is that the probability of transitioning to the next state depends only on the current state and is independent of how the system arrived at that state. 
Markov chains are widely used in various fields.

This R script demonstrates how to use Markov chains to analyze and generate text based on lyrics text files.

An example of a new song generated by the model:   

"my mind mind from    
Cry baby and sing a big star      
Please dont hear what I am the ocean   
Ill be long left his feat on my clothes   
Im too much is all right home and Ill do 
you look at last I want to me  Oh bring back    
Who knows shes my car    
You looked the world is  Paul
From a silver screen
When I needed someone "
